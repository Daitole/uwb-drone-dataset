# UWB Datasets for indoor UAV flights

The dataset has been recorded using two different methods, with rosbags being recorded either at the UAV or at a ground station. The first case includes data which has been acquired using an onboard computer on a quadrotor equipped with an active UWB tag and flying autonomously. The second case refers to data from a passive tag connected to a ground station, while the quadrotor is being flown manually. In the second case, a delay exists between the ground truth data given by the motion capture system and the UWB data due to the passive nature of the tag being used for recording the positions.

The autonomous flight tests have been done with an F450 quadrotor equipped with a Pixhawk 2.4 running the PX4 firmware, an Intel Up Board as a companion computer running Ubuntu 16.04 with ROS Kinetic and MAVROS, and a TF Mini Lidar for height estimation.
