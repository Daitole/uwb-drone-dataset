# UWB Localization for Autonomous UAV flight

** UWB-Based System for UAV Localization in GNSS-Denied Environments: Characterization and Dataset**. The paper is available *here*.

## Introduction

This repository contains a dataset for studying the accuracy of UWB-aided autonomous flight in UAVs, as well as ROS nodes to interface with Decawave's DWM1001 nodes when they are set as __Active Tags__ or __Passive Tags__. Finally, we also provide firmware for reprogramming the DWM1001 DEV boards in order to obtain fast and accurate autopositioning of anchors.

Compared to previous datasets, this dataset contains:

- Multiple anchor configurations
- Study of UWB accuracy when the UAV is both inside and ouside the convex envelope defined by the anchor positions

## Repository structure

The repository is divided in three main parts: ROS nodes, firmware for the DWM1001 DEV, and the dataset.
